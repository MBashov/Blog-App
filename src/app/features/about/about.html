            <h2>Discovering Myself & The World</h2>
            <p>My journey into the world of software development began with a lifelong fascination for computers 
                and an endless curiosity about how they work. That same curiosity is what drives my love for travel 
                — the desire to explore, learn, and experience something new.
            </p>

            <p>I created this blog app as a space where those two passions meet. Here, I can use my skills as a 
                developer to build something meaningful: a place where travelers can find inspiration, share stories, 
                and uncover hidden corners of the world.
            </p>

            <p>Travel, for me, isn’t just about ticking places off a list — it’s about the moments in between: 
                the early-morning sun glistening over the sea, the laughter of strangers who become friends, the 
                quiet reflection on a remote beach with no Wi-Fi in sight.
